A [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) plugin somewhat similar to pager duty, allows to have rotations with magic "solar lottery" scheduling, or overrides.

## About

- Solar Lottery is a team rotation scheduler, inspired by [PagerDuty OnCall](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/on-call-management/), and its predecessor the early amazon.com pager tool.
- Name from a Philip K. Dick novel "[Solar Lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Lottery)".
- The main motivation to develop was to automate the Sustaining Engineering Team (SET) schedulng.
- Not a traditional queue, scheduling is based on probabilities, exponentially increasing since the last serve time.
- Features (basic):
  - Users have skills, rotations have needs, match and constrain.
  - Grace periods after serving shifts, apply within the rotation.
  - User "unavailable" events.
  - Complete manual control over shifts, or "Autopilot"
